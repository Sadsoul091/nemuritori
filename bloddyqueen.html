I don't think people need this! (I’ve talked many times about the importance of this - but the players don’t want this, they just want to play!) but they also can’t play in equal conditions due to a lot of pressure! (so they just leave!). I realized what was happening on the server! from the very beginning I just jumped into the game and wanted to prove myself, play and enjoy the game, maybe make friends with someone.when I reached level 45 - I entered my first house on the SG server! (it was a Majestic house) at that moment there were about 25 of us - and the house was considered small! at that time there were many more people on the server (probably 10-15 times), they were mostly Arabs, Indians, and there was also a European home. and many others!the main struggle was between the musketeers and the Arab knights! Majestic house was the 7th independent house. That’s what it seemed to me, that’s why I joined it. (but in the first war, when I attacked the city of the Arab knights - by the way, I did this because the Arab knights were red - they captured part of the lands of our house and were declared enemies!)during the victory over the city of the Arab knights! (I killed 3 generals of the enemy army! They were commanders and the Arabs considered this an insult and therefore went to take revenge on me!) They pursued me and killed 1x5+ and besides that they wrote me a lot of insults.
        in the end I started answering them too! (and they realized that they could not intimidate me! Meanwhile, I spent all my time killing them one by one!) in the end they complained to the leader of my house and he told me to stop killing them and apologize to them! (to which I said that I would not apologize to them, but they were the first to insult me ​​and act in such a dishonest manner!)
        and my leader kicked me out of the house! (I was his strongest and most devoted) I don’t understand why he chose to do this over himself! he drove me out of the house even though the Arabs threatened him, he was a coward! he betrayed me even though I brought him many victories!
        In the end, this happened not only to me! (Arab knights intimidated other newcomers!) and other houses thought that it was better to lose 1-5 people than to fight against injustice! and a big army!the number of people like me began to grow! we began to unite and create our own homes! and those houses that betrayed us, one after another, concluded peace treaties with the Arab knights! they carried out all the orders of the Arab knights and killed those who did not kneel!The thinking and behavior of the old houses was much crueler! (these were free and warlike houses with strong leaders!)
        However, this could not continue for long! (I understood everything that was happening and said that we need to create an alternative and unite our houses into one secret union, otherwise they will kill us one by one!) but no one listened to me, everyone laughed and said that 1 of our soldiers can kill 5 Arabs!
        naive fools! (the Arabs at that moment had just begun to increase their strength! Many of them had been playing for only 3 months! Every newcomer becomes a veteran!) and even if we are stronger than them, no matter how much we kill, there is always a reserve to replace the dead! step by step they will break through any defense; this is an immortal army that is resurrected every two minutes!
        Finally, my friends and I joined the cohort! (we started playing solo!) we fought and killed everyone who the cohort met on the way!the war continued, time passed! (the musketeers lasted 2 seasons) then completely died! Only the houses that betrayed their allegiance to the Arab knight remained alive!The European house and the Assassins and Warlord fought against the Arab knights (Player Warlord). (previously he was in the house of the Arab knights but began to understand what was happening!) the server died, all competitors disappeared and left the game! There were very few worthy leaders left (only those at home who were afraid to fight remained) so he fought against the AK empire! to change this and restore balance, but he didn’t succeed! it gave way and disappeared. By the way, while he was fighting against the AK empire, I was in his house! 
        then the complete domination of the AK empire over the server! (in the end, even those houses that were subordinate to the AK authorities began to rebel, but it was too late!) he killed their traitors, took them into his army, and the rest left the game!The AK empire existed for 1 year! then they got bored and left too! (leaving behind an empty server - with the only power on it! (old generals of the house of AK and his wars who remained in control of the server) Gladiator empire!
        at that moment I created the bloody hundred! (the first Chinese houses arrived on the server!) RK FSL Hero house) seeing a weakened server and the only threat to the Chinese was the power of the GL Empire!
        The Chinese were very strong! There were a lot of Chinese! they easily won all the battles against the GL empire!
        In addition, my house of the Bloody Hundred and the house of Hades and other Indian houses fought against the GL empire, which, after a long vassalage, realized what they had done!my house was never a vassal! and we never stopped fighting! (but I was the last of those who survived the empire of ak! and did not give up)
        then when the GL empire lost almost all of its lands! and was in deep mourning! they started writing to us in particular to me and HAdes! they asked us for help and said that we would get the land and whatever we wanted! (I said that this does not suit me - I don’t need land and a slave’s crown! I wanted freedom from the power of the GL heir to the old empire AK!) I asked for territory for small houses and asked that the Imperial government not violate borders and not intimidate small houses! ) but they refused me! and I continued to fight against GL!However, I was the only one who said so! ( hades and others agreed to vassalage and submission to the GL empire in exchange for their safety! ) and also GL bribed the Chinese leaders from RB - (the current home of BBQ) and FSL left - the Chinese home of HEROES remained! and then we created the first coalition!I've been trying to create an alternative to the main power on the SG server for a long time! therefore it has always remained a priority for destruction! There are two types of empires! (the slave empire is what the current government uses - they took this style from the AK empire. What does a slave empire mean? and who are the slaves? If you have studied history, you should know many such examples! (the empire quickly gains strength and becomes powerful oppressing the weaker, killing brave warriors and absorbing those who are afraid to fight, thereby creating for themselves more influence and low-quality soldiers!)
        There are much fewer strong and independent leaders than cowardly ones!
        so it turns out that in the end you are fighting 1x3 - 1x5. Even if you are strong and brave, how long can you continue to fight against an army that cannot be killed?That's why many people don't have patience and endurance! even if they are not afraid, they are simply tired of fighting in such a war!Unlike the empire, the coalition is built on different principles! (a coalition is independent houses - we do not attack coalition members or other houses that are weaker than us! because there is no honor in defeating the weak and it is not interesting!) we grow due to the fact that we try to be noble and respectful to each other and do not try to destroy another house and, under pain of complete destruction, conquer it! each member of the coalition is a like-minded person; we conduct diplomacy and fight against villains and vile people for whom the word honor does not exist.Unlike the empire, the coalition is built on different principles!

        when a person knows that the truth is on his side when he knows that he is not alone! when he knows that his allies will be faithful until the very end no matter how fate turns! as long as he is honest and respectful, we will not abandon him and threaten him and will go to take the heads of every enemy, even if we have to fight alone against the entire server! Yes, there are few of us now, but the quality of such people is much higher! (they have no doubts about each other and they are fierce in battle! and they don’t give up!) Of course we understand that this is a game! (that's why real life is more important! Everyone has their own life! That's why we don't ask anyone to stay if they can't!)many people despair! they leave home when they don’t see results! (but I want everyone to understand! I can’t change everything with my own efforts!) Victory is the merit of each individual person who fights for this victory!ъ
        The prosperity of a home depends on the people who fight for their home in a territorial war! (if people are indifferent to the prosperity of the HOUSE, then the house will suffer and everyone in this house will suffer!) - and for our house it is twice as difficult! Well, we are not just trying to strengthen our house, but we are also trying to help others and punish the villains and change everything on this server!But our history of struggle speaks for itself and we don’t need words to prove our words! (when you want to understand who is who among a crowd of people - don’t think about what they say! There are a lot of snakes around - look at whether the words correspond to the actions!) A person’s actions will say more than a thousand words!while others humiliated and insulted and killed the weak! we offered them a helping hand! and they never bowed their knees, no matter how strong the enemy! (they tell us, I quote - This is just a game, enjoy it and don’t worry! - I agree with this, a game is a game! However, the attitude of people is not a game! They are all having fun until they find themselves in the place of the oppressed! when they fall into such conditions, they run with their tails between their legs, start crying or leave silently in shame) I saw a bunch of people like that, everyone who spoke like that then couldn’t say a word to me, it was very embarrassing!even the proud Emperor GL Wakim. for a long time he allowed his people to do what they wanted - his empire was built on fear and oppression! therefore, it was only a matter of time when those who once betrayed their friends - seeing the weakness of Emperor Wakim - would betray him too! such an empire will not last forever! and the only one who will remember her as a worthy enemy will be the one who fought against her! (now when I spoke with Warlord and some other generals - they called this man a stupid and weak leader!)But this man controlled the entire server for 2 years and defeated all enemies including the Chinese!
        so when all the traitors left him! and only the most faithful people remained! I supported him, I felt sorry for him. (this was also a great opportunity for the coalition - to get land without claims from the big houses!) where the weaker houses could develop! (I was the only one who supported him!) and I could talk to him - because he could not talk to me from a position of strength! he was in a critical situation. I think in the end he understood everything I was talking about!You see, there was no point in exchanging one enemy for another! people of ill repute were no longer part of the GL's house! (house This is not just a name - it’s every person in this house! if there is a lot of evil in your house) then your house will be evil. Gl before its destruction was no longer a place for bad people!
        As a result, the coalition and GL lost to the Zero alliance - They were ready to leave the game! (But I asked them a lot not to do this and tried to inspire them to fight!) Wakim left the game But some of his faithful warriors remained on the server without a leader! (I asked Wakim to appoint me as the new heir to the GL Empire. But he said that MERLIN would become the new heir to the empire. And then I said that I would restore the power of the old empire and take revenge on all enemies and traitors! In return for the old coalition land treaty!and I kept my word! 9 months of war and we restored the power of the empire! (The new house of BIA under the leadership of GL and the LO clan and the house of the avant-garde!) By the way, they offered me to become the third house in the empire, but I refused vassalage! (and asked to keep the word of the coalition agreement!) It’s better to be free than a slave with a crown! As a result, the Poka Poka alliance - they acted dishonestly with all their allies such as the direwolves!
        But as long as I didn’t break the contract, I hoped that I wouldn’t be betrayed! (I trusted them._ However, as soon as we completely dealt with RB and other enemies! (Poka Poka) immediately attacked the coalition of small houses - first was the Vanguard clan, then the Luo clan, then the BIA clan! For me, this betrayal was a strong blow!I want everyone to know that you can’t negotiate with them! (Their words don’t mean anything. Their words are just dirt!) They enslaved or destroyed everyone who negotiated with them! I thought that if I forgive them for all the years of bullying - if I show honor towards them, if I show them what loyalty is, they will change! But this is not so, these people are unworthy to rule the server and should be completely destroyed! (I don’t need peace in a game created for war! Peace in a game created for war is like poison! It destroys and kills the entire server!) and even more so if it concerns a world led by traitors and cowards! and which rests on fear!
        The coalition is not intended for peace! The coalition at the moment is the opposition to evil! however, the initial task of the coalition is to balance the forces between the houses! (so that, for example, a house of 40+ people cannot attack the house of a newcomer who has been playing for only 1 week or month and who barely has 5 soldiers in a territorial war!)
        big houses might not kill weak houses and newcomers! instead they could create their own factions and fight with equal houses! (that’s why we divided the land into a zone of influence) weaker houses fought with the weak and the strong had to fight against the strong!But they don’t need balance, they don’t need an interesting game and they are afraid of competition! they need power over the world - but their army is weakening, their policy is a policy of fear, if they are not afraid, then their houses die and the players stop playing! (but they are afraid to fight against houses of equal strength in order to maintain their online strength. Because if they cannot win, their people will leave!) That is why they choose weak houses as targets! to replenish your reserve of strength and support good online players!that is why they are very afraid that the coalition will grow and become a strong competitor! because they will no longer be able to intimidate anyone! and the weak houses will be united and if they offend someone, we will kill them!
        I'm really looking forward to the coalition being able to defend itself and punish those who think they can hurt others! and I won't give up until I do it!
        how my enemies treated me, how my own leader and my house behaved disastrously when they turned their backs on me in my hour of need! (I don’t want others to end up in my position! When you fight year after year alone against the entire server!)</p></p></center>
