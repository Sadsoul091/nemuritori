Started my journey in this game from the knightfall season I really dont have things to say about me cuz I am noob lol &#128512;. After 4 or 5 months of playing this game I am still a noob 	&#128513;. Although trying hard to make myself the best among all in the game and yes I know one day I can. OK, so now the first day I came in this game I was invited by my honorable seneschal BLACK BOI in Men At Farms, at that time he was leader of that house, but at last that house got killed by POKA POKA alliance. Then I was told to join VANGUARD house as the house is full of Indian guys. Men at farms got dismissed and people who wants to fight territory war to destroy poka poka joined the Nemu Ritori house. Then I thought why should I betray my first alliance and my first ingame friend BLACK (KATTAPA MAMA) and play in there oposing house. So, I joined Nemu Ritori as a Marshel to play side by side with people of my house. And now I am fighting aginst VANGUARD , BIA , BBQ and all our ingame enemies with Nemu Ritori &#128526;.
